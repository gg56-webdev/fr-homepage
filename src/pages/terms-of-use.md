1. FingeRate provides users with the ability to create their own surveys using “SoM”: Users can design and customize their surveys within the App. The Company reserves the right to moderate or remove any surveys that violate these Terms or are deemed inappropriate, offensive, or in violation of applicable laws or regulations.
